What we perceive sometimes confuses us.

We often fail to see ourselves in anyone or anything around us. So we start wandering in a place we create on our own, without a name, a shape and a purpose. As we try to understand who we are, it's easy not to trust our instincts, inevitably slipping on definitions that don’t represent us and make us feel unfit. Orienting ourselves inside and outside our bodies is difficult, especially if the compass at our disposal is damaged and we don’t know which way to go.

What if we let go?

What would happen if we listened more to ourselves and collectively self-determined our path?

The theme of [<cite lang='it'>Scambi</cite> 2023](/en/2023/program 'The complete program of Scambi Festival 2023') is VERSE with whatever meaning it may have or contain. Because we are especially ready to welcome your definitions, places and thoughts, transporting us together into a safe space where we can freely observe, experiment and experience the world in the making.

Whether you are introverts or extroverts, we are waiting for you to come and share our everyday lives, opening real (and fictitious) dialogues in search of OUR inclusive and mutant present.

An orientation  
A way of perceiving the world  
A set of words  
An animal cry of hope.

What’s your call?
