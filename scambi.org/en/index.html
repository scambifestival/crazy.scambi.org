		<h2 class='title'>What does <em>Paneurethic</em> mean?</h2>
		<p><cite>Paneurethic</cite> is a neologism we created to synthetize the meaning and values of Scambi. It derives from the Greek <em>pan</em> (all), <em>eurisko</em> (discover) and <em>ethos</em> (ethical living). We wish to combine diverse realities that would never meet in their original contexts, while celebrating and respecting our differences, discovering and developing inspiring ideas.</p>
