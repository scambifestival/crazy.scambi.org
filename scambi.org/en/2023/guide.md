Scambi Festival is a wonderful mess. We are always talking about the wonderful part, and a lot of people love what happens during those four unforgettable days, in *la Pigna*. However, we do acknowledge it: it‚Äôs a huge mess. This guide is meant precisely to unravel that mess and cover everything practically and simply.

## What will be done?

Four things can be done, all for **free**:

1. The Labs are the main thing. [Here](https://scambi.org/en/labs) you can find out about what they are and what is their philosophy. At the practical level, they are **workshops** lasting between 30 and 120 minutes and they are held in different locations, scattered around the neighborhood. Multiple workshops take place at the same time and in most cases they are repeated over the course of several days. Details for each Lab can be found in the program. Reservations are required!
2. The *Pinoli* are collateral to the Labs, i.e. presentations, kiosks, booths of our partners‚Ä¶ there are many, but they are all listed in [their dedicated page](https://scambi.org/en/2023/pinoli).
3. *Dissolvenze* is the section of Scambi dedicated to cinema. This year, it includes a very special cineforum‚Ä¶ find out what it will be like by reading [the program](https://scambi.org/en/program).
4. Dancing. Every night, there is **live music** that, in true Scambi style, touches all music genres. On our social channels, we will announce the artists who will perform, which, like everything else, are specified in the [program](https://scambi.org/en/program).

### The Passport

Upon your arrival, you will receive a foldable sheet we call **The Passport**. You will find written inside it all the information you need to experience the festival to the fullest, plus a map of *la Pigna*.

## We offer an accommodation!

Our association offers a **simple** and essential yet **free** solution if you would like to attend the festival but have no place to stay. You will be able to sleep in the gym of a school located in the heart of Sanremo, a ten-minute walk from *Porta Bugiarda*, where *la Pigna* begins.

(*Porta Bugiarda* is also the name of an excellent beer, brewed by NADIR Brewery, which held a Lab during the first edition of Scambi. You will be able to taste it at Scambi 2023, we will tap it during all of the nights üòç)

You can reserve a spot by filling out the form at [gym.scambi.org](http://gym.scambi.org), **BY AUGUST 10, 2023.**

In the gym we sleep on the floor. Bring your mat.

Any further details will be defined in the emails that will be sent to all people who have booked.

### Important notes!

- Although hospitality is free of charge, the association faces substantial expenses in setting up the festival, so we ask all people staying overnight to donate ‚Ç¨5 per night. Even if you don't want to donate, in order to verify your reservation and try to prevent problems, we still ask that you make a payment in our favor in advance (even one cent). You can do this in several ways: 
  - via PayPal, at palanche@scambi.org
  - via Satispay, by searching for "Scambi Festival" (the address should be "Piazza Oratorio dei Dolori, 7")
  - via bank transfer, made out to "A.P.S. Oltre," with IBAN IT63E0501801400000016986952

## How to get there?

Scambi takes place in *La Pigna*, the historic center of Sanremo. Access is almost solely pedestrian. Be careful not to confuse the name of the neighborhood with Pigna, a small inland village in Liguria.

### Ride sharing!

If you already know you're coming by car and you have some free spots or if you're looking for a ride, keep an eye on [the ride-sharing table](https://nuvola.scambi.org/s/QWoqXbCLGM7a6Z9 '2023 Scambi ride sharing')! (If a strange window appears when you open it, ignore it and close it by hitting the "x" in the upper right corner. We're working on getting it out of the way.)

### By plane

Don‚Äôt consider only the airports of Genoa and Milan! The one in **Nice**, France, is the closest and most convenient. Often, it is also the cheapest. From all these airports you can reach downtown Sanremo easily by Flixbus.

### By train

Our region is very poorly connected, but you can take either regional or Intercity trains that arrive at Sanremo station, which is a 15-minute walk from *La Pigna*.

### By bus

Flixbus stop in Sanremo; we don't know of any other services.
