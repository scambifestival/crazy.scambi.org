Scambi Festival is a wonderful mess. We enjoy talking about the wonderful parts of our festival and a lot of people love what happens during those four unforgettable days in *la Pigna*. However, we must acknowledge it: it can be a huge mess. This guide is meant to unravel that mess and explain everything you need to know practically and simply.

## What will be happening?

Four main areas will make Scambi alive and you can participate in all of them for **free**:

1. The Labs are the core of our festival. [Here](https://scambi.org/en/labs) you can find out more about them and their philosophy. They are **workshops** lasting between 30 and 120 minutes and they are held in different locations, scattered around the neighbourhood. Multiple workshops take place at the same time and in most cases they are repeated over several days. Details of each Lab can be found in the program.
2. The *Pinoli* are collateral to the Labs, i.e. presentations, kiosks, booths of our partners‚Ä¶ there are many of them, but they are all listed on [their dedicated page](https://scambi.org/en/2023/pinoli).
3. *Dissolvenze* is the section of Scambi dedicated to Cinema. This year, a very special film club is included dedicated to animation and interesting panels... find out what it will be like by reading [the program](https://scambi.org/en/program).
4. Dancing. Every night, there is **live music** that, in real Scambi style, touches upon all music genres. On our social media channels, we will announce the artists who will perform, which are also (you guessed it) specified in the [program](https://scambi.org/en/program).

### The Passport

Upon your arrival, you will receive a leaflet that we call **The Passport**. Inside, you will find all the information you need to enjoy the festival to the fullest, plus a map of *La Pigna*.

## We offer you accommodation!

Our association offers a **simple** and essential yet **free** solution if you would like to attend the festival but have no place to stay. You will be able to sleep in the gym of a school located in the heart of Sanremo, a ten-minute walk from *Porta Bugiarda*, where *la Pigna* begins.

(*Porta Bugiarda* is also the name of an excellent beer, brewed by [NADIR Brewery](https://birrificionadir.it), which held a Lab during the first edition of Scambi. You will be able to taste it at Scambi 2023, we will tap it during every music nightüòç)

You can reserve a spot by filling out the form at [gym.scambi.org](http://gym.scambi.org), **BEFORE AUGUST 10, 2023.**

In the gym, we sleep on the floor. Bring your mat!

Further details will be provided via email to the people who have reserved a spot.

### Important notes!

- Although hospitality is free of charge, the association faces substantial expenses in setting up the festival, so we suggest all people staying overnight to donate ‚Ç¨5 per night. Even if you don't want to donate, in order to confirm your reservation and prevent any issues, we still ask you to make a small payment in our favour in advance (even one cent). You can do this in several ways: 
  - via PayPal, at palanche@scambi.org
  - via Satispay, by searching for "Scambi Festival" (the address is "Piazza Oratorio dei Dolori, 7")
  - via bank transfer, to "A.P.S. Oltre," with IBAN IT63E0501801400000016986952

## How to get here?

Scambi takes place in *La Pigna*, the historic centre of the municipality of Sanremo. Access is almost solely pedestrian. Be careful not to mix up the name of the neighbourhood with Pigna, a small inland municipality in Liguria.

### Ride-sharing!

If you already know you're coming by car and you have some free spots or if you're looking for a ride, keep an eye on [the ride-sharing table](https://nuvola.scambi.org/s/QWoqXbCLGM7a6Z9 "2023 Scambi ride sharing")! (If an odd window appears when you open it, ignore it and close it by hitting the "x" in the upper right corner. We're working on getting it out of the way.)

### By plane

Don‚Äôt only consider Genoa and Milan airports! The one in **Nice**, France, is the closest and most convenient. Often, also the cheapest. From all these airports you can reach downtown Sanremo easily by Flixbus.

### By train

Our region is very poorly connected, but you can take either regional or Intercity trains that arrive at Sanremo station, which is a 15-minute walk from *La Pigna*.

### By bus

Many Flixbus rides stop in Sanremo; we don't know of any other services.
